    "content": "<p class='mb-6 text-[#E0E0E0]'>The React team has officially unveiled the features for React 19, marking a significant shift in how we build frontend applications. The focus this time is on performance, developer experience, and seamless server-side integration.</p><h3 class='text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4'>The React Compiler</h3><p class='mb-6 text-[#E0E0E0]'>Perhaps the most anticipated feature is the new automatic React Compiler. No more manual memoization using <code>useMemo</code> or <code>useCallback</code>. The compiler automatically optimizes your code, ensuring that components only re-render when absolutely necessary.</p><h3 class='text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4'>Server Actions</h3><p class='mb-6 text-[#E0E0E0]'>React 19 doubles down on Server Actions, allowing developers to call server-side functions directly from client components. This streamlines data mutation and reduces the need for separate API endpoints for simple tasks.</p><p class='text-[#E0E0E0]'>These updates are currently available in the Canary channel and will be rolling out to the stable release soon.</p>",
